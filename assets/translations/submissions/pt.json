Entender o passo a passo da criação de um plot, usando bibliotecas básicas, ou criar a saída para uma visualização em 3D ou animação pode mudar a percepção dos seus resultados para vários públicos.",
      "description": "Plotagem Customizada\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAs vezes precisamos de uma plotagem de dados mais impactante. Dependendo do público alvo, ou mesmo para uma melhor visualização dos resultados, gráficos com cores variadas, plotagens em um campo 3D usando texturas, iluminação e transparência, podem fazer toda a diferença em comunicar os resultados de uma pesquisa.\r\n\r\nOs vários pacotes científicos do Python são integrados com bibliotecas para plotagem de dados acadêmicas consagradas e padronizadas. No entanto, nem sempre a saída obtida por essas bibliotecas padrão, como a matplotlib, ggplot e seus derivados tem um resultado final agradável. Embora quase sempre tenham o resultado mais acurado, geram uma saida visualmente estéril dos dados, mais preocupada em exatidão das medidas e label-ticks:os interessados nessas medidas podem bem visualizar os dados diretamente na forma numérica - a principal intenção de plotagem de gráficos é justamente tornar os resultados mais atraentes. \r\n\r\nPython é uma linguagem de programação completa, que integra e manipula dados em mais domínios do que estamos acostumados. Nesta apresentação, teremos uma demonstração de como criar alguns tipos de gráficos a partir do zero, em várias bibliotecas que disponibilizam apenas uma API 2D simples, o que nos permite customizar cores e formas. Exemplos de bibliotecas que podem ser usadas são a Pygame, tkinter e pillow. \r\n\r\nÉ possível também usar mecanismos de template de texto do Python para gerar saídas de gráficos diferenciados em 2D, gerando diretamente código Postscript e 3D com texturas foto-realistas, transparências e sombras gerando arquivos para o renderizador Povray.\r\n\r\nDentre outras possibilidades, esses mecanismos também permitem a criação de gráficos animados, permitindoa  incorporação de uma dimensão a mais aos dados, ou comparando séries diferentes elaborando-se alguma forma de transição entre as mesmas. \r\n\r\nEspera-se que o público entenda a ideia de que a visualização de seus resultados não está limitada aos temas padronizados que acompanham as bibliotecas de postagem, e que sempre é possível apresentar os gráficos de forma bastante estética e chamativa, usando toda a flexibilidade que o Python proporciona. ",
      "notes": "Esta palestra pode ser bastante útil tanto para pesquisadores querendo mostrar seus resultados para um público diferente do público acadêmico, como para perceber a possibilidade de plotar resultados em tipos de gráficos ainda não existentes nas bibliotecas existentes.\r\n\r\nTambém é interessante para estudantes e professores perceberem que ao escreverem suas próprias rotinas para um criação de um plot, se dá um entendimento muito melhor de quais realmente são as grandezas envolvidas, e do significado dos dados do que escrever `plt.plot(...)` e ver um resultado padronizado, mas com pouco significado. \r\n\r\nO palestrante é desenvolvedor Python há mais de 15 anos, e tem grande interesse nas áreas de criação de imagens e bibliotecas gráficas.

We will learn how to build a cryptocurrency from scratch, analyzing the components that power a blockchain, and the advantages of a decentralized, crypto-secured structure.",
      "description": "In this workshop, we will begin by asking ourselves the reasons to build a digital currency. We'll review the postulates of the cypherpunks and their motives to develop a currency for the internet, with a focus on privacy and security. Then we'll try to build a digital currency in the most intuitive way. \r\nWe'll start out by coding a naïve, centralized, PayPal-like digital currency. The shortcomings of this approach will be exposed: it's serious risks regarding reliability and security. We'll conclude this weaknesses emerge from it's centralized nature, and we'll try to rethink our digital currency to avoid a single point of failure. \r\nSubsecuently, we'll review decentralized protocols, moving from a server/client structure to a gossip protocol. As we test it out, we'll notice that, even when we have achieved fault-tolerance, we still lack Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT). \r\nTo establish an effective method of authentication, we'll introduce the concept of cryptographic identities, and learn the basics of public-key cryptography for asserting a message's authenticity. \r\nAfter integrating asymmetric encryption into our gossip protocol, we'll notice we still suffer the double-spend problem. We'll review a few approaches to solving the double-spend problem, most of them using centralized architectures, taking us to the first shortcomings we explored. \r\nAt this point, we'll realize the main issue with decentralized protocols is that often, peers can't agree on the timing of certain events. We'll conclude we'll need to implement a decentralized timestamping server, and here we'll introduce the blockchain as a data structure that provides a notion of order among its blocks, while making it very hard to change that order thanks to the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. \r\nDuring the implementation of the blockchain, we'll look at the elements that form it, such as the notion of mining and the fork resolution methods (longest chain rule). \r\nAs the workshop has a limited timespan, we'll have to skip a few topics, such as the economics of cryptocurrencies, the concept of merkle trees, SPVs, as well as smart contracts and other DLT like hashgraph or tangle.\r\nNevertheless, at the end of the workshop, the audience will have a basic understanding of the work of blockchain technologies, which are becoming mainstream in the coordination of human activity, and a key player in current and future approaches to emerging technologies such as distributed computing and AI (paramount tools for computer scientists in the 21st century).",

      "abstract": "What are you doing to control abusive content on your platform? Can your current solution tell the difference between \"f\\*\\*king awesome\" and \"f\\*\\*king loser\"? Can it detect racist and sexist content?\n\nYou will learn how to build a deep learning based solution and deploy it as a micro-service.",
      "description": "Offensive / abusive content is a major issue for social-media and digital interaction platforms. In some jurisdictions (Eg: Europe), platform providers are required to remove such content within 24 hours of posting or risk hefty fines (upto €50M in Germany). In order to meet the governance mandate, we need to have systems in place that can automatically detect abusive content at scale. This talk is based on my practical experience of building an automated solution to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThis talk begins with discussing some of the approaches currently being employed in industry for offensive content detection at scale: word filtering, rule-based systems and actual human annotation.\r\n\r\nThe former two are restricted by the following:\r\n\r\n-   Offensive content is context specific. A given word (f\\*ck) can be used in both positive (that’s f\\*cking awesome) and negative ((that’s f\\*cking terrible)) contexts.\r\n-   Robustness to spelling variations (The word ‘shit’ can be spelt as ‘sh\\*t’, ‘sh!t’, 'shiite', etc)\r\n-   Failure to detect content that is offensive in idea but uses non-offensive words. (Eg: your mom is a fat cow, X people are inferior, etc)\r\n\r\nManual human annotation is notoriously hard and expensive to scale. The talk presents a Deep neural network based approach to overcome the previously mentioned limitations. It introduces and discusses the building blocks of model architecture (deep convolutional networks, word embeddings, etc).\r\n\r\nThe second half of the talk focuses on implementing the above model to solve the problem at scale as a RESTful micro-service using python, Django, Tensorflow and Docker. This architecture can also be used to implement other text classification systems as well (eg: user intent detection systems, topic-of-discussion classifiers, etc.), making the talk relevant for a wider user base.\r\n\r\nAttendees will:\r\n\r\n-   Gain insights into building deep learning based text-classification systems that can scale\r\n-   Learn the nitty gritties of the offensive content detection and text classification\r\n-   Learn about the basic concepts of Deep Learning and NLP (convolutional neural nets, multi-layer perceptron, word embeddings, etc.)\r\n-   Understand the scientific and software challenges involved in text classification and learn to overcome them\r\n-   Be able to apply the learnings from here to solve other text classification problems at scale\r\n",

The talk will also introduce a Python recommender framework, called CaseRec.",
      "description": "## Context and Motivation\r\n\r\nFrom 2005 to 2020, the information in the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes (more than 5,200 gigabytes for every man, woman, and child in 2020) [1]. It is simply not possible to grasp even a small percentage of it in a single lifetime, there is too much information to process and to choose. The expression Information Overload was introduced to describe the sensation of fatigue and distress that follows the cognitive surplus required to handle the volume of information we have to deal with every day. Recommender Systems (RS) have emerged in response to the information overload problem by learning from users about their interests from past user actions (ratings, votes, ranked lists, mouse clicks, page views, product purchases, etc.) and suggesting products that are likely to fit their needs.\r\n\r\nMany e-commerce and social media companies are leveraging the power of data science and boosting sales by implementing Recommender Systems on their platforms. This approach aim to predict users’ interests and recommend products that quite likely are interesting for them. In this context, this talk aims to provide support for professionals and researchers to know fundamental concepts about recommender systems, as well as the use in practice of techniques of recommendation and evaluation of these systems in their research and applications, aiming at personalization and optimization of the user experience in their systems.. The talk will also serve to introduce a Python recommender framework, called CaseRec [2]. The framework implements the well-knows and state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms in rating prediction and item recommendation scenario, with several evaluation methodologies.\r\n\r\n## Rationale of Interest and Audience Attraction\r\n\r\nThe growing amount of information available on the web and the technological advancement with new e-business services and social networks have provided a content overload to users, providing the emergence of Recommender Systems. Currently, these systems play a key role in sites such as Americanas, Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Spotify and Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn), in order to attract and loyalty users.\r\n\r\nIn this context, this talk is intended for professionals and academics from research areas related to user experience who wish to use Recommender Systems in their research and applications, but find conceptual or practical difficulties in the development of their applications. The participants will gain insight on how to develop and evaluate the recommendation tools in practice.\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n\r\n* Recommender Systems Overview\r\n* Filtering Paradigms\r\n* Generating Users and Items Representations\r\n* Neighborhood and Matrix Factorization Models \r\n* Tools and Evaluation\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2012iview/\r\n\r\n[2] https://github.com/ArthurFortes/CaseRecommender/",
      "notes": "## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Participants\r\n\r\nDue the focus of this tutorial is on presenting concepts and developing recommender approaches for participants with no previous experience, no prerequisite knowledge of programming languages or specific software is required. For the practical examples, the Python language and its scientific libraries will be used and explained: NumPy, SciPy, Sklearn e Pandas.\r\n\r\n### Computational and audio-visual resources\r\n\r\nRegarding the computational and audio-visual resources required, it would be interesting, but not impeding, that each participant have access to a personal computer capable of executing and processing commands in Python [https://www.python.org], preferably using the Linux operating system. It would be more attractive for participants to be able to run the examples themselves that will be made available through GitHub [https://github.com/]. For presentation, only one projector and one projection screen will be required.",

After graduation I discovered the area of Data Science and since then have focused all my efforts on building my career.\r\n\r\nSince then, I had the opportunity to lead the data science team at Chaordic, the largest online retail recommendation system in Brazil. There I was able to apply the SciPy stack to problems such as:\r\n\r\n- Develop new product recommendation algorithms for our E-commerce customers;\r\n- Provide ad-hoc analyses to find insights from our data;\r\n- Design and monitor competitive A/B experiments devised to validate our systems performance in the face of competition.\r\n- Internal A/B testing tool using the SciPy and Jupyter stack;\r\n- OMNI channel recommender systems;\r\n- Mixed collaborative filtering and content based algorithms;\r\n- Continuous space parameter optimization using exploration/exploitation policies;\r\n- Bandit algorithms for online optimization;\r\n- LNC's Machine Learning Challenge for talent acquisition: https://goo.gl/EVdXsH\r\n\r\nToday I work at Code:Nation building predictive models and chat bots to help developers skyrocket their careers.",

      "abstract": "Ever had memory and performance issues while trying to use pandas, numpy and sklearn? You probably tried to side-step this by migrating to some other module like pyspark, but it just isn't as friendly. What if I told you you could scale all 3 almost effortlessly with Dask and absolutely 0 cost?",
      "description": "Creating custom reports and machine learning models with pandas can be cumbersome with limited hardware resources (memory and CPU). Financial constraints can make spawning cloud instances to side-step this issue a problem, while adding the complexity of libraries such as Apache Spark isn't worth the trouble and staggers data exploration. How can we keep the simplicity and power of pandas, while extending it to be out-of-core and parallel?\r\n\r\nEnter Dask: a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing. With it we will create a linear regression model to predict read time in Medium posts using a Kaggle dataset, while comparing the equivalent implementation with pandas.",
      "notes": "I've been using the SciPy stack and sklearn since 2013, and Dask since 2017. I found that it has solved most of my performance issues when trying to do data exploration, cleaning and general EDA while trying to build machine learning models and create custom reports in big data companies like Chaordic.\r\n\r\nI have also contributed to Dask and Dask-ml:\r\n- https://github.com/dask/dask-ml/pull/9\r\n- https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/2710\r\n\r\nThe only technical requirements for this talk would be that each person have their own laptop computer.",
