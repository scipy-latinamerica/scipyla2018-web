# Financial Terms

## Philosophy/Outreach

Financial assistance is provided so those who might otherwise not be able to attend can. This includes major diversity and outreach programs through PyLadies and Python User Groups to attract new speakers, students, and attendees.

SciPyLA have a financial aid program to help people attend SciPyLA. Financial aid recipients have some part of their expenses (which can include travel, hotel, registration) paid for with the SciPyLA financial aid budget. We actively encourage people to apply for financial aid. The SciPyLA board welcomes and encourages applications from students. While we wish we could give grants to everyone who applies, we do not have the funds to do that. Our goal is to get the most people to SciPyLA by optimizing the funds we have.

Optimal is, of course, an ambiguous property.

SciPyLA is a meeting place for Scientists and Python developers from all around the globe. Therefore, the process is particularly designed to benefit people that we believe make SciPyLA better, particularly speakers and tutorial presenters, as well as notable open source contributors.

Additionally, the process attempts to promote a more diverse conference. While encouraging diversity is a broad effort, we're happy to say that the financial aid program has been a important factor in our results so far.

Finally, the process tries to help people with relatively lower incomes, be it because of their location (lower income countries) or their profession (such as students, or the unemployed).

In short, we use the financial aid budget to help individuals who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference.

The financial aid program is about the community nurturing itself by making itself more accessible at SciPyLA. It is true to the spirit of SciPyLA, by helping to make the information and interactions available to everyone.

## Disbursement

Disbursement of funds will be onsite during the conference in BRL. You can choose between bank transfer or a Paypal transfer.

No funds will be disbursed prior to the event. Only those that have filed their disbursements (with receipts) will be reimbursed.

## Financial Aid FAQ

Q. Should I register for the conference before I find out if my financial aid application has been approved?

* A. No - Financial Aid applicants do not need to register in the fear that the conference will sell out! We set aside tickets for Financial Aid recipients. The ticket can also be filed for reimbursement (you will be reimbursed either the grant amount, or the total amount you have filed for reimbursement, whichever is lower).

Q. Where can I find out the status of my grant application?

* A. You will be notified by email before August 27, 2018.

Q. If I request more funds after my grant has been approved, will that affect my current grant?

* A. If you can not attend on your current grant, you may optionally request additional funds through the SciPyLA contact email, contact [at] scipyla.org, instead of accepting or declining your grant. We can not guarantee that we will be able to accommodate you, since our budget is tightly stretched. This will put you in a second funding round where we try to redistribute funds from people who have declined their grants. Please note that if you are requesting more funds, and we are unable to allocate more funds, your previous grant will no longer be available; this option is only intended for people who would not be able to attend SciPyLA on their current grant.

Q. What if I need help with a visitor visa?

* A. We can provide you with an "Invitation Letter" upon request, in support of an application for a visitor visa. It confirms that as a registered delegate you are invited to attend by the SciPyLA committee.

Q. How do I upload my receipts for reimbursement?

* A. If your application has been approved, and you have accepted, you can send an email to contact [at] scipyla.org. Please note that all receipts must have your full name on them. We cannot process your reimbursement if your name is not on the receipt.

Q. Why do I need to send my receipt for registration? Don't you guys already have it on record?

* A. This is an organizational rule. If you don't send your registration receipt, it will not be counted towards your grant.

Q. Can I be reimbursed for food?

* A. Yes. We can add a per-diem cost for food to count for your expenses. It's automatically applied if and only if the total of receipts for flight, lodging + (optionally) conference pass do not exceed the grant amount.

Q. How do I send a hotel receipt when I haven’t yet checked out?

* A. A credit card secured reservation is an acceptable expense receipt. The receipts need to add up to or greater than your grant amount before we can issue your grant (to show that the grant is a reimbursement and not an income).

Q. Can I be reimbursed for mileage?

* A. Yes. We only ask for a list of expenses (essentially, to demonstrate that this is a reimbursement and not taxable income).

Q. What if I don’t come to SciPyLA?

* A. If you do not register and attend SciPyLA, you will not receive your grant.

Q. What if my receipt is larger than my grant amount?

* A. You can send a receipt (example - airfare) for an amount larger than your grant, but you will only be reimbursed for the amount you were awarded.

Q. How do disbursements work?

* A. Disbursement of funds will be onsite during the conference in BRL. You can choose between bank transfer or a Paypal transfer.
